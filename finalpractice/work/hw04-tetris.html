       <h3 class="small">Tetris (Russian: Тетрис [ˈtɛtrʲɪs]) is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984 for the Electronika 60. The game has been published by several companies over time, most prominently during a war for the appropriation of the game's rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights of the game reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing for Tetris.

Tetris challenges the player to create complete lines by moving differently-shaped pieces – the tetrominoes, which scroll from the top to bottom of the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the point that additional pieces can no longer descend. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer games, the players must last longer than their opponents, and in certain versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a significant number of lines. Some adaptations have provided variations to the game's theme, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving pieces.

Built on simple rules and requiring intelligence and skill, Tetris has established itself as one of the great early video games titles. Since its creation, Tetris has sold 202 million copies – approximately 70 million physical units and 132 million paid mobile game downloads – as of December 2011, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time; the Game Boy version in particular is one of the best-selling single titles of all time, with over 35 million copies sold. The game is available on over 65 platforms, setting a Guinness world record for the most ported video game title. Tetris is rooted within popular culture and its notoriety extends beyond the sphere of video games; imagery from the game has influenced architecture, music and cosplay. The game has also been the subject of various research studies that have analyzed its theoretical complexity and have shown its effect on the human brain following a session, in particular the Tetris effect.</h3>

       <h3 class="small">Through the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West. He was regularly invited by journalists and publishers, through which he discovered that his game had sold millions of copies, from which he had not made any money. However, he remained humble and proud of the game, which he considered "an electronic ambassador of benevolence". In January 1990, he was invited by Spectrum HoloByte to the Consumer Electronics Show, and was immersed in American life for the first time. After a period of adaptation, he explored American culture in several cities, including Las Vegas, San Francisco, New York City and Boston, and engaged in interviews with several hosts, including the directors of Nintendo of America. He marveled at the freedom and the advantages of Western society. Upon returning to the Soviet Union, he would never stop talking to his colleagues about his travels. He then realized that there was no market in Russia for their programs. At the same time, Nintendo saw sales of the Game Boy – bundled with a handheld version of Tetris – explode, exceeding sales forecasts three times.

In 1991, Pajitnov and Pokhilko emigrated to the United States. Pajitnov moved to Seattle, where he produced games for Spectrum HoloByte. In April 1996, as agreed with the Academy ten years earlier and following an agreement with Rogers, the rights to Tetris reverted to Pajitnov. Pajitnov and Rogers founded The Tetris Company in June 1996 to manage the game's rights on all platforms, the previous agreements having expired. Pajitnov now receives a royalty for each Tetris game and derivative sold worldwide. In 2002, Pajitnov and Rogers founded Tetris Holding after the purchase of the game's remaining rights from Elorg, now a private entity following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Tetris Company now owns all rights to the Tetris brand, and is mainly responsible for removing illegal clones from the market the company regularly calls on Apple Inc. and Google to remove illegal versions of Tetris from their mobile app stores. In December 2005, Electronic Arts acquired Jamdat, a company specializing in mobile games. Jamdat had previously bought a company founded by Rogers in 2001, which managed the Tetris license on mobile platforms. As a result, Electronic Arts held a 15-year license on all mobile phone releases of Tetris, which expired on April 21, 2020.</h3>
